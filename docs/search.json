Since there I have been dedicating my studies on conservation and at 2019 I started to write a project to find out the priority areas for conservation of Brazil nut trees with climate and genetics analyses. At 2020 the project was approved and I started to study R language, which is quite cool and it brought to me the area that I was looking for which is: environmental data science.\r\n  So the main goal for this blog is to keep myself studying it and posting things about data science regarding my forest studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
