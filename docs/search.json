      "contents": "\nHi!\n \n \nHello, my name is Gabriel de Freitas Pereira, and I am a Forest Engineer. I began my studies in 2018 and have since been focusing data analytics. In 2019, I initiated a project aimed at identifying priority areas for the conservation of Brazil nut trees. This involved genetic and climatic analyses, and in early 2020, the project was approved. I also took the opportunity to learn R language, which has been incredibly exciting as it has allowed me to explore the field of data science.\n \nWith this blog, my primary goal is to keep myself engaged in the topic and share my insights in the context of my studies on analytics.\n\n\n\n",
