Since there I have been dedicating my studies on conservation and at 2019 I started to write a project to find out the priority areas for conservation of Brazil nut trees involving genetic and climatic analysis. At beginning of 2020 the project was approved and I started to study R language, which is quite cool and it brought for me the area that I have been studying intensively which is environmental data science.\r\n  So the main goal for this blog is to keep myself studying it and posting things about data science regarding my forest studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
