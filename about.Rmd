### Hi!
\   
\  
I'm a Forest Engineer with a strong interest in data analytics, visualization, and experimentation. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science, which allows me to deepen my expertise in these areas. Alongside my studies, I work as a Data Analyst at Uber, where I apply my analytical skills to solve complex problems and drive data-driven insights

\ 
Through this blog, my main goal is to stay connected with the community and share my insights as I continue to explore data analytics in the context of my studies.
