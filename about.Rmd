### Hi!
\   
\  
Hello, my name is Gabriel de Freitas Pereira, and I am a Forest Engineering student at UFSCar (Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos). I began my studies in 2018 and have since been focusing on conservation efforts. In 2019, I initiated a project aimed at identifying priority areas for the conservation of Brazil nut trees. This involved genetic and climatic analyses, and in early 2020, the project was approved. I also took the opportunity to learn R language, which has been incredibly exciting as it has allowed me to explore the field of data science.

\ 
With this blog, my primary goal is to keep myself engaged in the topic and share my insights on data science in the context of my studies.
