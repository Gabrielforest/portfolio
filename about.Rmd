### Hi!
\   
\  
My name is Gabriel de Freitas Pereira and I am a Forest Engineering student from UFSCar (Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos) and I started to 
study it at 2018. Since there I have been dedicating my studies on conservation and at 2019 I started to write a project to find out the priority areas for conservation of Brazil nut trees involving genetic and climatic analyzes. At beginning of 2020 the project was approved and I started to study R language, which is quite cool and it brought to me the area that I was looking for which is: environmental __data science__.

\ 
So the main goal for this blog is to keep myself studying it and posting things about data science regarding my forest studies.
